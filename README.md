# Squash-the-Creeps
This was my attempt of learning and making a 3D game with Godot Engine with the help of the Documentation, Sequel to Dodge the Creeps, Now we Squash the Creeps by jumping on them.
# How to play:   
We control the player character with the WASD keys or Arrow Keys.  Jump with space.  Thats it! ~~Kill~~ Squash the Creeps, Make a Highscore (No highscore storing feature tho..)  
# Download  
The release tab has both Linux and windows version, just extract somewhere and play ;)
# Have Fun
